This is a personal project for a podcast I manage.

The file path will need to be changed to point to .xml file.

The prompts are pretty straightforward.

Future modifications/additions:

* Clean up code
* Change media file names to certain format so the script can read the title, author, time, date, and media type from file name.
* Scan directory for list of files and create entries automatically.
* Pull file size and duration from file.
* Remove the closing </channel> and </rss> lines when initial new entries are made.
